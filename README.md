## Advent of code 2023

In ruby since I've never used it for this before

### Instructions 

Run a day by using the bash script `./run` and the day/part as parameters

To run day 1 part 1
```
./run.sh 1 1
```

To run day 3 part 2
```
./run.sh 3 2
```


To turn on the **many** debug comments add a DEBUG env variable
```
DEBUG=1 ./run.sh 3 2
```
